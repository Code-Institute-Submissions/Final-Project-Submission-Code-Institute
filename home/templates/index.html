        <p>Our primary goal is to track bugs and features reported by the community. Bugs will be tackled free of charge as we all want UnicornAttractor working as best as possible. As for features; as these are extra requests from the community and will take more time and effort to implement, we will focus on whichever features get voted the most.<br><br> Also, as we are doing this as a self-powering project and are not being payed, we would like donations from feature nominations. <br><br>We will strive to complete all tasks in a timely fashion and we will leave updates of the process in the tracker to show "To do", "Doing" and "Done". <br><br>Thank you for all your continued support.</p>
