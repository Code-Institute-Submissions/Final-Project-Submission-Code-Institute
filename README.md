## Testing
Manual testing was undertaken for this application and satisfactorily passed. Tests were conducted as follows:

2. Integration testing - Tested combinations of units to ensure new code doesn't interfere with existing code
3. Acceptance testing — Tested the application in sevreal different browsers and devices to analyze the performance of the entire application.
4. Code which was credited, was tested as the example given, then modified for desired outcome
5. Test.py files were created to ensure code was opperating
